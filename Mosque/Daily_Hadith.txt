          'Abdullah b. 'Umar
          reported: I went to
          Allah's Messenger
          (may peace be upon
          him) in the morning
          and he heard the
          voice of two persons
          who had an
          argumentation with
          each other about a
          verse. Allah's Apostle
          (may peace be upon
          him) came to us (and)
          the (signs) of anger
          could be seen on his
          face. He said: Verily;
          the (peoples) before
          you were ruined
          because of their
          disputation in the
12/15/2022Book.

           The Prophet said;

           Israel; meat would not
           decay; and were it not
           for Eve; no woman
           would ever betray her
